# Thresholding


Thresholding Problem Statement: The binary threshold operation is the simplest way to extract foreground objects in a given grey-scale image.  Given an image and a threshold value, the binary threshold operation is to transform pixels in the input image from grey-scale to binary values, where
    
	if input(i, j) >= threshold value then 
	   output(i, j) <- 1
	else
	   output(i, j) <- 0
	   
 Thresholding Output File: 
  a) Output: The name of the output file will be generated by your program at run time and is tied to the name of the input file and the threshold value used to do the threshold operation. For example, if the input file name is “imageData1” and user gave 10 as the threshold value, then the name of the output file should be “imageData1_thr_10”; if the threshold value given is 38, then the name of the output file should be “imageData1_thr_38”, etc.
	
  b) The output binary image also needs to have the image header.


PrettyPrint purpose is to visualized a given image.  PrettyPrint will be used in many occasions, for grey-scale and binary images.
